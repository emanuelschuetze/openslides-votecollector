OPEN ISSUES:

1. Openslides needs to provide some plugin hooks into agenda and motions.

Currently, I replace the following openslides files with the ones provided in this package:
agenda/static/js/agenda/site.js
agenda/static/templates/agenda/item-detail.html
motions/static/js/motions/site.js

Search for "FIXME JW" in those files to find the currently provided hooks.

2. Form to add keypads by range

3. Projector message "Vote now"

4. Motion slide with seating plan and vote status shown while votecollector is running

5. Projector message with instructions on how to get on the speaker list when votecollector is running

6. Change seat number (AP 1.3)

7. Translation

8. Review setup.py
